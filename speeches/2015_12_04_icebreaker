Cheater.

vim: set ai sw=4 wm=5:

I'm a cheater.  I'm a low-down cheatin' cheater from cheatin' cheatsville.

Okay, I'm not *that* kind of cheater.  Get your minds out of the gutter,
people.  But I am standing here before you under false pretenses and you
would be quite right to view me with great scepticism.

The purpose of this speech is supposed to be to face one's fear of
standing up in front of a group of people and speaking for the first time.
Unfortunately, I've done this shit before.  Even more unfortunately, I've
let that limb atrophy, so although I'm not facing that same fear almost
everyone has the first time they stand up in front of a group like this, I
*am* nervous, and I *am* going to suck at this a bit.

Prepare yourselves for:
- dubious language choices
- questionable content
- abrupt changes in direction.

<sniff> Power.  Courderoy.  Boilerplate.  Crud.  Death cookies.  Freshies.
The magic eraser.  Cottage cheese.  Slop.  Fluff.

They say Alaskans have a hundred words for snow.  I think skiers do, too.
Some of you who know me know I'm bordering on unhinged about skiing.  It
doesn't mean I'm *good* at it (I spend a lot of time skiing with people
who make it really obvious that I'm not), but I am completely addicted.
Better yet, I have a pretty good story about how I became addicted, and
started teaching.  (Warning, there is death in this story.  The TLDR
version is this: about 8 years ago, my oldest brother literally had a heart
attack and died skiing at Kirkwood.  For my birthday the next summer, my
wife bought me a season pass to ski at Kirkwood.  It turns out he took a
lot of lessons there, and that year, I got to know a number of the
instructors that he knew there, and eventually they ended up asking if I
was interested in teaching.  I should point out that without exception,
every person who suggested I should try teaching said, "it's okay; you
don't have to be a very good skier; we'll teach you."  It turns out they
were right.  I used to be a good skier.  Now I'm better.  Now, I'm
a bad skier.  Don't become a ski instructor.

Quick diversion back to the cheatin' cheater comment: Kirkwood used to have
one of the instructor trainers who would take a group of relatively junior
instructors (the ones who usually teach beginners), would ski them 1/2 way
down an intermediate run next to some trees, and then would make them all
take off 1 ski and finish the run.  He'd say, "see, now you know what
everyone you're teaching feels like.  Pretty scary, huh?"  By extension, I
guess I should be up here singing or dancing.  I'm not very afraid of just
talkig in front of a group, but it would be a *real* underwear changing
situation if I had to do either of those.

Vegetables.  I love vegetables.  However, in classic 'Princess Bride'
fashion, I will tell you that I don't think that word means what you think
it means!  *My* favorite vegetables come in 12-ounce bottles.


So, in conclusion, I guess you could say I'm a lazy, cheatin'
beer-swilling, spastic skier.  Yep.  That's about right.
