Cheater.

I'm a cheater.  I'm a cheatin' cheater from cheatin' cheatsville.

Okay, I'm not *that* kind of cheater.  Get your minds out of the gutter,
people.  But I am standing here before you under false pretenses and you
would be quite right to view me with great scepticism.

For, the icebreaker speech is supposed to be about facing one's fear of
standing up in front of a group of people and speaking for the first time.
I've done this shit before.


Themes to bring in:

- trainer who had instructors single-ski a run to remember how scary it can
  be.
- trainer who said make sure to ski something that frightens you every day.

- love teaching / helping others unlock what they are good at
- evaluating is more fun that speaking

- it's good to be afraid
- this is a great place to fail

- I'm lucky to be someplace like Pure.
- We are *all* lucky to be in the time and place we are
- We are in the center of a massive, world-changing upheaval, and it's so
  pervasive, so "commonplace", so ordinary, that we forget to even notice
  it.
