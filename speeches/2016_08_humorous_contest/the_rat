I'd like to talk to you about vermin.

I have a long and sordid history with vermin.
- grade school: meal worms.
  - Ted -> Tedrica
- high school, maggots in the garage trash can
- high school, possum under parents house
- college: mice
- appartment in Oakland: racoons
- first home: mice, millipedes
- current home: potato bugs

Let me get some teminology out of the way up front:
- squealing like a little girl
  - I've heard little boys squeal, and as a general conisseur of embarassing noises made by humans,
    I will assert that generally little boys squeal louder and at a high pitch than little girls,
    but saying "There I was squealing like a little boy" is a lot more likely to bring up a mental
    image of Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka than it is to bring up what I want to convey.  Let me
    make this perfectly clear: Augustus Gloop is ... a ... lot ... cooler than I am.  I want you
    thinking somewhere between Violet Beauregard stomping her foot, saying, "I want an oompa-loompa,
    right now!" and Jamie Lee Curtis in Psycho right before she gets the dagger.
    So ... squealing like a little girl.


  - 3 car collisions.  It turns out that it's a lot better to have me driving, than being
    a passenger.  Once, I was in the back seat of a friend's car, stopped waiting for a green
    light, about to cross a street at the bottom of a hill.  Right as the light turned green,
    I looked up the hill and as we began to accelerate into the intersection, I saw a car barrelling
    down the hill toward us.  Any rational person would say, "woah; look out!  There's a car coming
    toward us, you need to get out of the intersection right now!"  That's not what I said.
    I froze.  I sat transfixed in the back seat of the car, eyes growing wider, as the inevetable
    bacame more inevetable, the best I could do was, about 1 second before impact, open my mouth and
    say, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUGH!"  BAM!  I'd say I was sheepish after that, but I think even a
    sheep would have said BAAAAAAAAAA, early enough to have done some good.
