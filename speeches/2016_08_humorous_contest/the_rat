I'd like to talk to you about vermin.

I have a long and sordid history with vermin.
- grade school: meal worms.
  - Ted -> Tedrica
- high school, maggots in the garage trash can
- high school, possum under parents house
- college: mice
- appartment in Oakland: racoons
- first home: mice, millipedes
- current home: potato bugs

Let me get some teminology out of the way up front:
- squealing like a little girl
  - I've heard little boys squeal, and as a general conisseur of embarassing noises made by humans,
    I will assert that generally little boys squeal louder and at a high pitch than little girls,
    but saying "There I was squealing like a little boy" is a lot more likely to bring up a mental
    image of Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka than it is to bring up what I want to convey.  Let me
    make this perfectly clear: Augustus Gloop is ... a ... lot ... cooler than I am.  I want you
    thinking somewhere between Violet Beauregard stomping her foot, saying, "I want an oompa-loompa,
    right now!" and Jamie Lee Curtis in Psycho right before she gets the dagger.
    So ... squealing like a little girl.


  - 3 car collisions.  It turns out that it's a lot better to have me driving, than being
    a passenger.  Once, I was in the back seat of a friend's car, stopped waiting for a green
    light, about to cross a street at the bottom of a hill.  Right as the light turned green,
    I looked up the hill and as we began to accelerate into the intersection, I saw a car barrelling
    down the hill toward us.  Any rational person would say, "woah; look out!  There's a car coming
    toward us, you need to get out of the intersection right now!"  That's not what I said.
    I froze.  I sat transfixed in the back seat of the car, eyes growing wider, as the inevetable
    bacame more inevetable, the best I could do was, about 1 second before impact, open my mouth and
    say, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUGH!"  BAM!  I'd say I was sheepish after that, but I think even a
    sheep would have said BAAAAAAAAAA, early enough to have done some good.

It was about 1 in the afternoon.  I had taken the train to work, so there was pretty much no way
I was getting home before dinner time.

  - Hey, are you home tonight?
- Yes
  - Let’s go over the benefits open enrollment stuff together and make our choices for the year.  I’ll take the earlier train.
- Something fell through a vent in the roof. It's in the vent over the dad chair.
- Freaking the hell out!
  - Yikes!  Is it alive?
- Oh yes
  - Holy crap!
- I'm moving out.
  - I can deal with it when I get home, but you might not want to be there for most of the day.
- The cat and dog are sitting staring at the ceiling.
  - I bet!  Heck, I’d be staring at the ceiling.
  - You can probably call animal control or an exterminator.
- No idea what to do!!!!!!!
- Should I? Ok
  - If I were there, I’d probably do something like: go find something like a butterfly net, hold it against the ceiling while unscrewing the vent cover, and when the vent cover and whatever the hell it is falls into the bag, cinch it shut, take it outside and either release it or finish it off.
  - There is likely a vent cover on the roof that needs repairing, too.
- Which is different than my running in circles screaming.
  - Sorry for going quiet.  In meetings.
  - What can/should I do?
- I've got calls into a couple of exterminators. Looks like tomorrow.
- If you can get it tonight, that round be great
- You can also scream. Screaming made it stop moving
  - I’ll definitely try tonight.
  - I don’t want to scream.  That will hurt throat.
- It wasn't voluntary
  - I'll still check tonight. The dead case is not thrilling.
- Still screaming
  - Train is pretty much on time.  I’ll be home before 7.
  - Then it’s time to deal with the beastie.
- I'm in Idaho
  - Joining a rodent-killing militia, I assume.
- Hoping to find a Guerrilla to take care of it for me
  - Or buy a black-market RPG?
- Video game?
  - Rocket Propelled Grenade.
- Ah! Yes
  - Not Role Playing Game (ala Dungeons and Dragons).
  - Home in 20.
