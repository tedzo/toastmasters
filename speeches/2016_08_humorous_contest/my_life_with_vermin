Snails
====
When I was a wee lad, I had a mother.  I grew up in Los Altos, very close to here, and when
I was a kid, the tech industry was here, but suburbia was more spacious, and even really
busy roads like El Camino alternated between apricot and cherry orchards.  The point is that
it wasn't quite so sterile and built-up.  And my mom ... well my mom grew up on a farm in
Indiana.  She was a bad-ass.  She raised cows, pigs, chickens, and the real world, the messy
world of interacting life forms on this crazy-ass planet of ours didn't bug her at all.
Except spiders.  She didn't like spiders.  But I digress.  My mom had a garden, and it
... was ... her ... garden.  Los Altos had snails.  Snails liked my mom's garden.  I'd
almost say I felt sorry for them.  Except I don't.  She tried all kinds of stuff
to get rid of the snails.  She tried Ortho snail pellets (Ha!).  The snails just lauged
at her in thier little French snail way: "hah hah hah, you stupeeed American woman; do you
not know that we are Escargot?  We laugh at you and your pathetic little chemicals!"  She
tried stomping them, she tried enlisting us to help kill them, bit it was like Germany trying
to hold back a Russian army coming from the east.  There were just too many; they kept coming.
They were fanatics, willing to die for a cause.  But my mom was *not* going to lose this war.
She studied them.  She watched them.  She thought about strategy.  She got into their little
escargot brains.  In the end, her final solution (and I don't use that term lightly), involved
learning their daily habits (snails are most active in the early morning when it is cool out,
and there is fresh dew on everything), a natural affinity for chemistry, and the cold-hearted
ruthlessness of a natural born killer.  For a few months, she woke up every morning a little
before 6, went out with a brown paper lunch bag (or multiple bags early on), and gathered up
all the squishy beasties, thew them into the bag(s), brought them back inside, and dumped
a handfull of salt in with them, closed the bag and shook it all up, turning the whole
thing into a foamy, bubbly hot-mess of gastropod.  the other downside, was as we all got
ready to go to school, we were *very* suspicious of the lineup of brown paper bag lunches
along the counter top.

Maggots.

Insect larvae.  When I was a not so wee lad in high school, I had a cold one day and stayed
home from school.  I was sitting around wearing shorts, a T-shirt and flip-flops.  The flip-
flops are important.  At lunchtime, I made myself some soup, and when I went to throw
away the soup can, the trash can was full.  So, I grabbed the bag of trash to take it
to the garage and throw it into the big trashcan there.  Now, I should tell you that
when I was a kid, my folks did a remodel on our house and built a 3-car garage.  It's
important to note that this was 3 stalls side-by-side.  With a laundry area between the door
from the house and the first stall.  So it was a long way.  And the trash can was against
the FAR wall.  On the way *to* the can I was a typical kinda-but-not really sick teenage
boy walking through the garage.  I was probably thinking ... girls ... video games ... pizza.
Girls ... video games ... pizza.  I got to the can and my whole world collapsed!  I lifted the
lid, and suddenly, my feet were not my feet.  They were a bizarre pile of swarming shifting
maggoty goo.

====
Mice
====
When I was in college, I lived in a fraternity house.  Yes; you'd be well within your rights
to simply declare that *we* were the vermin.  But stupid college antics aside, a bunch of
undergraduate guys living together in a house is just ... not ... that ... tidy.  One year,
a very nice community of mice decided to cohabitate with us.  Given our high standards for cleanliness,
and high degree of motivation to keep our environment pleasant, we probably would have just
let them be except for the fact that mice leave mouse droppings.  So, we had one guy in the house
who was the mouse man.  He put out the sticky traps; he monitored them, and when he found a
mouse in a trap, he was the one who would go get the bucket of water, and drown the little
guy.  (If you didn't know this, there are no girl mice.)  One week he was out of town.  You
can guess where this is going.  So we fast-forward to the moment when I find my first mouse
in a sticky trap.  I am not a steely-eyed stone-cold killer.  I might have thought that I
could handle reality, but I couldn't.  I got the bucket, I got the mouse in the sticky trap.
I filled the bucket with water.  And I looked at the bucket.  And I looked at the mouse.
And the mouse looked at me.  And I looked at the bucket.  And I looked at the mouse.
And the mouse looked at me.  And I looked at the bucket.  And I looked at the mouse.

I couldn't do it.  I just couldn't do it.  But I couldn't just leave the mouse in the trap,
either.  Knowing the right thing to do is different than being able to do the right thing.
So, I got creative.  I took the mouse outside.  I looked around, and what did I find?
(Hold up brick.)  I looked at the bucket.  I looked at the mouse.  I looked at the brick.
I put the mouse in the sticky trap down on the ground, I held the brick up over him, I 
closed my eyes and I dropped the brick.

...

When I opened my eyes, the impossible had happened.  The brick was simply lying FLAT ON
THE GROUND.  I don't know what *you* would expect to see when you drop a brick on a mouse,
but holy cow, I was not expecting to convert a living, space-filling 3-dimensonal
creature instantaneously into into 2 dimensions.  I mean it was GONE.  I picked up the brick,
and there was literally NOTHING on the ground.  The brick, the mouse, the sticky trap had
all merged into an entirely new object: the brick-trap-mouse.








Let me get some teminology out of the way hup front:
- squealing like a little girl
  - I've heard little boys squeal, and as a general conisseur of embarassing noises made by humans,
    I will assert that generally little boys squeal louder and at a high pitch than little girls,
    but saying "There I was squealing like a little boy" is a lot more likely to bring up a mental
    image of Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka uthan it is to bring up what I want to convey.  Let me
    make this perfectly clear: Augustus Gloop is ... a ... lot ... cooler than I am.  I want you
    thinking somewhere between Violet Beauregard stomping her foot, saying, "I want an oompa-loompa,
    right now!" and Jamie Lee Curtis in Psycho right before she gets the dagger.
    So ... squealing like a little girl.


  - 3 car collisions.  It turns out that it's a lot better to have me driving, than being
    a passenger.  Once, I was in the back seat of a friend's car, stopped waiting for a green
    light, about to cross a street at the bottom of a hill.  Right as the light turned green,
    I looked up the hill and as we began to accelerate into the intersection, I saw a car barrelling
    down the hill toward us.  Any rational person would say, "woah; look out!  There's a car coming
    toward us, you need to get out of the intersection right now!"  That's not what I said.
    I froze.  I sat transfixed in the back seat of the car, eyes growing wider, as the inevetable
    bacame more inevetable, the best I could do was, about 1 second before impact, open my mouth and
    say, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUGH!"  BAM!  I'd say I was sheepish after that, but I think even a
    sheep would have said BAAAAAAAAAA, early enough to have done some good.

It was 10:04 AM.  I had taken the train to work, so there was pretty much no way
I was getting home before dinner time.

If you're keeping tally, and I'm being honest, I have to admit, the score is vermin 2,

  - Hey, are you home tonight?
- Yes
  - Let’s go over the benefits open enrollment stuff together and make our choices for the year.  I’ll take the earlier train.
- Something fell through a vent in the roof. It's in the vent over the dad chair.
- Freaking the hell out!
  - Yikes!  Is it alive?
- Oh yes
  - Holy crap!
- I'm moving out.
  - I can deal with it when I get home, but you might not want to be there for most of the day.
- The cat and dog are sitting staring at the ceiling.
  - I bet!  Heck, I’d be staring at the ceiling.
  - You can probably call animal control or an exterminator.
- No idea what to do!!!!!!!
- Should I? Ok
  - If I were there, I’d probably do something like: go find something like a butterfly net, hold it against the ceiling while unscrewing the vent cover, and when the vent cover and whatever the hell it is falls into the bag, cinch it shut, take it outside and either release it or finish it off.
  - There is likely a vent cover on the roof that needs repairing, too.
- Which is different than my running in circles screaming.
  - Sorry for going quiet.  In meetings.
  - What can/should I do?
- I've got calls into a couple of exterminators. Looks like tomorrow.
- If you can get it tonight, that round be great
- You can also scream. Screaming made it stop moving
  - I’ll definitely try tonight.
  - I don’t want to scream.  That will hurt throat.
- It wasn't voluntary
  - I'll still check tonight. The dead case is not thrilling.
- Still screaming
  - Train is pretty much on time.  I’ll be home before 7.
  - Then it’s time to deal with the beastie.
- I'm in Idaho
  - Joining a rodent-killing militia, I assume.
- Hoping to find a Guerrilla to take care of it for me
  - Or buy a black-market RPG?
- Video game?
  - Rocket Propelled Grenade.
- Ah! Yes
  - Not Role Playing Game (ala Dungeons and Dragons).
  - Home in 20.

Notes from club level speech
====
- Only got through snails, maggots, and mice.  Never got to the Rat.
- That's really bad when the props where there for everyone to see, and I never used the duct.
- Spent too much time with into to each story.
  - Too much time on the bay area when I was a kid, on the snails story.
  - Too much time on the house and the home sick building on the maggots story.
  - Too much time on the sticky trap drowning.
- Maggot story was kind of confusing right as I went to describe what happened at the trash can.
