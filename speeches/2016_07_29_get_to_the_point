Fail Early Fail Often

Oh God.  Why am I suck a fuck-up?  I have to give a speech tomorrow, and I
have NO .. FUCKING .. CLUE what I'm going to talk about.  Why did I ever
sign up for this?  I will NEVER .. EVER sign up for a speech that isn't
already at least 1/2 written again.  EVER.

Wait a minute, holy cow, that's it!  I've got it!
They say, talk about what you know.
They say, talk about what you're good at.
They say ... well they say a lot of shit, but this is GREAT.  I'll get
right to the point about what I'm BEST AT.  Yes, I'm going to talk about
...
Fucking up!  Now *THAT* is what I'm best at.

  Wake up every day wondering, "is today the day that everyone around me
  discovers that I am a complete fraud?"

Pure
  here with a *ton* of people who are *way* smarter than I am.

Random:
We are *here* because we have all seen people who are great speakers or
presenters and thought, "I'd like to do that!"  But we are *all* scared,
*none* of us are good at this yet, and we *all* have to put ourselves out
there in front of everyone.

If you aren't occasionally so scared, so deeply terrified that you are afraid
you're going to wet yourself, then maybe you're just playing it safe.  Maybe
you're on the slow-but-steady path to improvement, but maybe, just maybe,
you could use a little shaking-up.  Maybe you should try something you
REALLY .. DON'T .. KNOW you can accomplish.
