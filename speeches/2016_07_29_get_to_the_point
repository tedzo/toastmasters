Early and Often

Thursday 8:17 AM.
Oh God, I'm such a fuck up.  Why did I ever sign up for this?
I will NEVER .. EVER sign up for a speech that isn't already at least
1/2 written again.  EVER.  All right, all right, it's a nice day; here
I am, walking through this nice neighborhood with its grand old trees,
at the corner of HOPE and MERCY!  It's going to be okay.

Thursday 3:04 PM.
Oh God.  Why am I such a fuck-up?  I have to give a speech tomorrow, and I
have NO .. FUCKING .. CLUE what I'm going to talk about.

Thursday 3:06 PM.
Wait a minute, holy cow, that's it!  I've got it!
They say, talk about what you know.
They say, talk about what you're good at.
They say ... well they say a lot of shit, but this is GREAT.  I'll get
right to the point about what I'm BEST AT.  Yes, I'm going to talk about
...
Fucking up!  Now *THAT* is what I'm best at.

When I was in grade school, I don't think I *ever* had a report card come
home that didn't say, "Ted does not live up to his potential."  That is a
much stronger data point than you might expect, since my Mom saved *all*
of my report cards.

In 3rd grade, I was put in a reading group for the kids who are struggling.
It was one of the best experiences of my life.  First off, I *loved* my
3rd grade teacher (Mr. Leiwer), and secondly, by midway through the year
he told my parents, you know, he has the vocabulary of a high school senior.
(And no, that wasn't because I was throwing F-bombs down in the classroom.)

I can't tell you how many assignments I had throughout my education where
I was up late the night before, berating myself for screwing up, and wondering,
why didn't I just do the damned work earlier?  Actually, I *can* tell you.
ALL OF THEM.  Once, in high school, I was really stressing out about writing
an English paper, so I actually wrote it 2 days in advance.  It felt great.
Then sometime around noon the next day, I realized that I didn't know what
I had written or where I had put the paper, and in true Stephen King
fashion, the horror slowly dawned on me that I had only *dreamed* that
I had written the paper and hadn't actually done it.  That is a true story.

It wasn't until I was out of college that I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD,
and I at least had *some* explanation for what the heck goes on in my
head.  I read Edward Hallowell's "Driven to Distraction," and I will say that
multiple times I was literally in tears saying, "that's me!" as I read
descriptions of the crazy, counter-productive stuff my ADD bretheren
(and sisteren to steal a line from Firefly), have done.  I can honestly
say that if you decide to learn about your flaws, be careful, sometimes
it's nice to have a name and an explanation, but it can be enormously
frightening, and sometimes disheartening to read that you are the way
you are because you're wired that way, and it isn't just something you
can "get past."

But then, in the great, constant irony of life, our weaknesses are almost
always our strengths.  When I was a young engineer, I would constantly
read stuff (perl, tcl, expect, lisp, man pages, etc), when I *should* have
been working on stuff I needed to deliver.  But just messing around and
getting a "feel" for systems has come in handy so many times in the last 20
years, I can't even begin to tell.

When my kids were small, I used to coach their soccer teams and after a
few years, I realized that the crazy 5 year olds who would always go for it
and always wanted to get their feet on the soccer ball might be frustrating
at 5, and sometimes even hilarious (scoring in the wrong goal, anyone?),
but by the time they turned 8, they were always amazing players.

Look, for the most part we are engineers working for an enterprise
data storage company.  Most engineers spend most of their waking hours
trying to avoid doing something wrong.  At a data storage company, we can't
lose or corrupt customers' data.  Ever.  But if you spend all your time
in your comfort zone, how will you know where your limit really is?

Which brings us to the here-and-now.  We are *here* because we have all
seen people who are great speakers or presenters and thought, "I'd like
to do that!"  But we are *all* scared, *none* of us are good at this yet,
and we *all* have to put ourselves out there in front of everyone.

If you aren't occasionally so scared, so deeply terrified that you are afraid
you're going to wet yourself, then maybe you're just playing it safe.  Maybe
you're on the slow-but-steady path to improvement, but maybe, just maybe,
you could use a little shaking-up.  Maybe you should try something you
REALLY .. DON'T .. KNOW you can accomplish.

I wake up just about every single day, thinking, "is today the day that
everyone around me discovers that I am a complete fraud?"
 I look around this room, and I think, "holy crap, what am *I* doing
here?  I see people who are feakishly smart, more capable, more determined,
generally harder-working, and *way* more capable of staying on-task
than I am, and to be honest, it's pretty damned intimidating.

But all I've got, all I can do is go for it, and
consider myself lucky I'm here.


But you know what?

  Wake up every day wondering,

Pure
  here with a *ton* of people who are *way* smarter than I am.
