Want to use Toastmasters involvement as the call to action.

Experiences presenting as personal stories:
  Funerals
  Pure Accelerate this year
  All hands meetings with my team

Recall speech 9 where I invoked specific people's strengths.

Don't go too meta.

I'm the old guy; embrace it.  I've seen a lot.

Accept failures small and large.

Learn to appreciate what others bring; it may not be what you bring, and they
may not be good at what you're good at.
