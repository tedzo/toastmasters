I'm a spaz.  I don't even know if I'm allowed to say that anymore.  I'm pretty sure
I'm *not* allowed to call myself a tard.  Even though I kind of am.

In my early adolescence, I had a huge fear of heights.  I was terrified of getting
up on the top of a 1-story ranch-style house roof, riding my bike or skateboard
over even a small jump my friends would take easily, or even riding roller
coasters.

Somewhere around my sophomore year of High School, it started to change.  Maybe
it was just flat out adolescent hormonal changes, maybe it was that I had
fallen off a lot of stuff and found that I survived, maybe it was that
as my body got stronger and more coordinated (or less uncoordinated), I gained
confidence.  Don't get me wrong, it isn't that I quit being scared, but it
quit being overwhelming shut you down kind of scared and it became Neo
watching Morpheus jump between skyscrapers kind of scared.  Woah.

I really remember going up onto the roof of a neighborhood church where I
attended a youth group, (aside about expolorations of being a Christian vs.
an agnostic vs confidently athiestic?) and walking right to the edge, and
standing there looking down.  With just a touch of nervousness.
