For 5 years, I was a ski instructor.
  (caveats?)

PSIA identifies 4 primary skills involved in skiing:
    Balance Pressure, Edging, Rotary
    Balance is primarly one's body's orientation relative to one's skis and
        the mountain.  Front/Back and Left/Right.
    Pressure is very closely related to balance, but is active: both causing
        of and reacting to changes in balance.  It's how much force one is
        putting on each ski, or how much pressure to apply to the tips of
        the skis instead of the tails.  It can also be big changes in overall
        pressure against the snow: for example if one is jumping or hopping.
    Edging is using the edge of the skis.  It controls how much a turn is
        carved or skidded.  Angulation vs leaning, and keeping one's knees
        and one's skis equally spaced apart are critical factors in edging.
    Rotary is specifically rotating body parts relative to each other.  It can
        be steering the skis with ankles or hips, or it can be controlling
        how much one skis counter vs. squared up.

Early on, as a skier and as an instructor, I learned that with most
people, balance is the first thing to focus on.  When one's balance is
off, nothing else works right.  But as I progressed subltleties became
more apparent.  The skills blend together and reinforce each other.
