Commitment Anxiety

Main points:
We don't suffer from performance anxiety; we suffer from commitment anxiety.

We are here to get better.
We don't have professional speakers in our club.
We have to bootstrap ourselves.
We should all be able to learn from the best of everyone here.
    - Mia's welcoming personality and super ability to just show what she means.
    - Oren's HUGE (and irrepressible) personality on stage.
    - Zach's intensity and intellectual curiosity
    - Ayesha's flat out determination to get shit done NOW!
    - My experience as a manager and teacher? (and the first-hand experience
      of mistakes that come with it).
I *want* us to:
    - become a place that people of many skill levels want to come to learn
      and improve.
    - develop our skills as speakers, evaluators, and coaches.
Ski instructor training:
    - First they teach you to ski
    - Then they teach you to teach the most basic ski skills to beginning
      skiers.
    - Then they teach you to ski better.
    - They they teach you to manage a ski class safely.
    - Then they teach you to ski better.
    - Then they teach you about 4 fundamental ski skills:
      balance, pressure, rotary, edging.
    - Then they teach you to analyze a skier's movements
    - Then they teach you about learning styles.
    - Then they teach you about teaching styles.
    - Then they teach you to ski better.
    - Then they teach you about physiology and how various muscles, bones,
      and joints interact when skiing.
    - Then they teach you about child/adolescent development stages
      (both physical and psychological) so you can create appropriate
      lesson plans.
    - Then they teach you to ski better.

Everything there has an analog in Toastmasters.
    Balance, pressure, rotary, edging
    Speech writing, vocal variety, movement, use of space, eye contact.
We have to learn, experiment, succeed, fail, push each other, support each
    other, CHALLENGE each other to get better.
But, it can't happen if you don't do it.  Get up here.
    Speak.  Evaluate.  Toastmast.  Topic some tables.  Take a chance.
    Take a lot of changes.  Do something twice, thrice.

Twice a week you have a chance to learn by watching, learn by doing, learn
    by evaluating.

Will *you* commit to getting all you can from that opportunity?

Speech
-------
Why are we here?

This could be a cosmic, philosophical question about the origins of the
universe, or about broad human purpose, or even about our corporate identity
or giving back or diversity.

But it isn't.  At least not really.  I'm asking why we, the people here,
in this room *are* here, in this room.

Since this is a speech and not a discussion, you may rest assured that the
question is rhetorical.

And in the great (perhaps hackneyed) tradition of using rhetorical questions
in speeches, I'm only asking, so I can tell you *my* answer.

I believe we are here because we believe we can improve ourselves by being here.
