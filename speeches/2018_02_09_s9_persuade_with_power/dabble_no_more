Why are we here?

This could be a cosmic, philosophical question about the origins of the
universe, or about broad human purpose, or even about our corporate identity
or giving back or diversity.

But it isn't.  At least not really.  I'm asking why we, the people here,
in this room *are* here, in this room.

Since this is a speech and not a discussion, you may rest assured that the
question is rhetorical.

And in the great (perhaps hackneyed) tradition of using rhetorical questions
in speeches, I'm only asking, so I can tell you *my* answer.

I believe we are here because we believe we can improve ourselves by being here.
