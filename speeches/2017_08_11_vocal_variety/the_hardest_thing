Points to cover:
- Why are we here?
  - Almost certainly some variant on wanting to grow personally and develop
    a *skill* for speaking in public.  Notice that I didn't say talent.

- Like most good engineering companies, Pure strongly values individual
  contribution, being able to walk the walk, do the task, and even
  collaborate.
  - Even in leaders, we hold up the people who are good at the job themselves,
    seem like they could jump in and perform the task of the person they are
    mentoring, managing, guiding or working with as a peer.

- But one thing you almost never hear about is leading from behind.

- Most insightful advice I have ever gotten as a manager:
  - sometimes you have to hold other people accountable for doing things
    you aren't good at yourself.

- So now, the shit gets real at the same moment that it gets meta.


conclusion:
- I hope you can come away from this with:
  - You can get *more* from toastmasters.  Put in the work; try to memorize
    an entire speech.
    - Don't be a Ted.
  - Find insight whereever and whenever it comes to you.  What is deep and
    meaningful to me may not be what is deep and meaningful to you.  (Although
    usually people appreciate something that seems insightful to others.)
  - Be sympathetic to your manager; I guarantee he or she is dealing with
    some weird shit.
