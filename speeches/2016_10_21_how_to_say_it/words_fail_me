  "Physics is to mathematics as sex is to masturbation." - Richard Feinman
   <Long Pause>

  Alan ...?

Okay; I *know* that got your attention.

It's a quote attributed to Richard Feinman.  But what the heck does that mean?
When searching for quotes to use today, I came across this one, and there
is some disagreement about the central point.  Some argue that it's really
a statement that mathematics is a solo activity while physics generally
requires cooperation among <ahem> *more than* one person.  Others think
it's a statement about real-world applicability of the work.

But that brings me to my first point: effective communication is not
*solely* or even *primarily* about being unambiguous.  All forms of
artistry, including speaking only become transcendant when they allow
the recipient to interpret they work for herself.

My personal favorite interpretation is that maybe that's why there's
a Nobel prize for physics and not one for Math.
